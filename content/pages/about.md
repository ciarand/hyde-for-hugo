In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr.
Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and
effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by
[@mdo][]. The whole thing was then ported over to Hugo by [@ciarand][].

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde][hyde]

* [Lanyon][lanyon]
