Hyde is a brazen two-column [Hugo][hugo] theme, ported from its
[namesake][original] for use with Hugo, that pairs a prominent sidebar with
uncomplicated content.  It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll
butler.

[hugo]: http://hugo.spf13.com/

### Built on Poole

Since this port truly stands on the shoulders of giants, we get all of the
following benefits:

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation
for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme
built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:

* Complete Hugo setup included. Layouts, config, a 404 page, an archive page,
  and even an RSS feed are all included. Thanks @mdo!

* Mobile friendly design and development

* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS

* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements

* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet
  highlighter)

### Hyde features

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated
  navigation with active link support

* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and
  [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar),
  available via `<body>` classes

* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes),
  available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme][original] to learn more.

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest
versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only
compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the [Github
repository][repo] for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.
Alternatively, visit the original Hyde (for Jekyll) [here][original].
