[Hugo][hugo] is a static site generator. It's an open-source tool for creating
simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's
readme][hugo-readme]:

>Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. It is optimized for speed, easy
>use and configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and
>renders them into a full html website.

It's an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Hyde.
